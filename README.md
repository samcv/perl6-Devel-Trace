# Devel::Trace  [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Altai-man/perl6-Devel-Trace.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Altai-man/perl6-Devel-Trace)

**DEPRECATED. As for rakudo(and this module uses it anyway) you can just put 'use trace' in your source files.**

This is a Perl 6 port of Perl's Devel::Trace.

This port is rather rough, feel free to open issues.

You can invoke tracer like `perl6-debug-m -DDevel::Trace example.p6`.
